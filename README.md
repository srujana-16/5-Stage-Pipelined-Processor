# Intro to Processor Architecture - Project (Spring 2022)

## 1.Overall Goal 

Develop a processor architecture design based on the Y86 ISA using Verilog. 

## 2.Specifications

The required specifications in the processor design are as follows:

- A bare minimum processor architecture to implement a sequential design as discussed in Section 4.3 of
textbook. 
- A full fledged processor architecture implementation with 5 stage pipeline as discussed in Sections 4.4 and 4.5
of textbook, which includes support for eliminating pipeline hazards. 

## 3.Design Approach
The design approach should be modular, i.e., each stage has to be coded as separate modules and tested independently
in order to help the integration without too many issues.
